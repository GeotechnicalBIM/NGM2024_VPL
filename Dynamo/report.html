                This report is created to demonstrate the use of visual progamming languages in geotechnical engineering. The chosen example is a pile foundation, which is created parametrically. This report is created from a python node within Autodesk Dynamo. The report is written in HTML. It is instantly updated, when inputs and therefore its content, are changed.

            <h4>About the design</h4>
            <p>
                The design consists of 75 piles. The total volume of the piles is 776.44 cubic meters. The slab on top of the piles has the area of 1058.76 square meters.
